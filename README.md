# Lesson 1

- Goal is to create a Zombie Factory to build an army of Zombies !

- Roles of the factory :

  - Act as a database for all the zombies creaed from our factory.
  - Create a new zombie with random and unique apperance.

- Zombie DNA : 16 Digit integer. Different parts of this number would give values to different characteristics of the zombies.

- Contracts : Fundamental building blocks of ETH application.

- Version Pragma : All solidity codes start with ther version pragma, which decalres the version of the Sol compiler the code should use.

- State Variables : permanently stored in contract storage, i.e. written to ETH block chain.

- Solidity Provides us Structs to create more complex dtypes from the ones that it provides us

- Arrays :

  - Fixed array : uint[2] fixedArray;
  - Dynamic array : uint[] dynamicArray;
  - Public array : uint[2] public publicFixedArray;

- If function parameter contain array, struct, string, mappings then they should have memory keyword for those parameters.

- Private functions only accessbile inside our contract.
  - Convention is to use underscore in names of private function
